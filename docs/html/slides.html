[Give pause so that people can read the title of the slide]

OK, so to begin this presentation. 
Hi, my name is Luiz Carlos Rumbelsperger Viana, 
I am an undergraduate student of computer science 
in Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, PUC Rio.

This presentation is the result of my undergraduate 
scientific initiation research into interactive theorem provers
with professor Hermann at PUC Rio. It is the first paper I publish, 
and my first presentation at a congress.

I am going to explain today my implementation of the 
soundness proof of first-order predicate logic 
in the Lean interactive theorem prover.

# Motivation of our work

* .large[Personal learning].
* .large[Using Lean for teaching logic to others in the future].
* .large[Future investigations into the formalization of meta-theorems of logical systems].


???

In this project we were motivated primarily by the opportunity for personal learning
of the Lean theorem prover itself as a formalization tool, and of the details involved in the
soundness and consistency proofs of first order predicate logic. 
We were also interested in the possibility of using Lean as a tool for teaching 
logic to students in the future, since code is often able to clarify most ambiguities in the 
presentation of a complex topic such as the soundness and completeness proofs of a logical 
calculus.

So, in the future we plan to formalize the completeness proof of the calculus for our personal understanding. 
One interesting research problem in this direction would be to investigate by formal
means the pros and cons of an algebraic proof of completeness (via Cyllindric algebras) 
versus the more classical Godelian proof.

# Lean Prover

* Developed since 2013 by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research.
* Open source, great documentation, vscode extension, emacs mode.
* Emphasizes automation (like Isabelle/HOL), through a metaprogramming framework.
* Higly expressive like Coq (CiC).
* Can naturally express much of mathematics (e.g. Perfectoid spaces).

**Many projects seeking to formalize most parts of undergraduate level mathematics in Lean 
(Mathlib, Xena project, Lean Forward, etc...).**


???


About the Lean prover itself, it is a prover that builds upon 
the calculus of inductive constructions and aims at integrating proof 
assistants with proof automation. You can write your own proof procedures 
in the same language as the theorem prover itself, via a tactics metaprogramming framework.  

[Describe bullet points]

So, personally I started learning Lean as my first proof assistant. 
That makes it hard for me to compare it with other proof assistants,
since I don't have the same experience with Isabelle and CoQ. 
I preferred diving a little bit deeper in Lean than trying to learn to use 
several provers at once.

# Implementation Difficulties

* Too many different ways to do essentially the same thing (high language abstraction).
* Trying out a "wrong" idea can be costly.
* Intricate syntactical details involving variable substitution.

???

Moving on to the implementation, 
TODO



Intricate syntactical details involving variable substitution generates many additional lemmas
about the semantics substitutions that would probably be glossed over in a standard 
presentation of the soundness proof.

---

# Implementation

* Syntax
  - **Signature/Language**
  - **Terms**
  - **Formulas**
  - Rewrite/Substitution system
  - Variables
  - **Proof system**
  - Proof Examples
  - **Consistency definition**
* Semantics
  - **Structures and variable assignment**
  - **Term references**
  - **Satisfiability of formulas**
  - Lemmas
  - **The Soundness proof**
  - **The Consistency proof**

Roughly 1000 lines of Lean code.

???

We divided our implementation into 2 modules, the first
handles the syntax of the language and the deductive system, 
the second gives semantics to the language and contains the soundness 
and consistency proofs. The project has roughly 1000 lines of Lean code.

We are going to explain today the sections of our work marked in bold. 
The other sections will have to be skipped since it would 
be impossible to explain them within 10 minutes.

# Signatures

```haskell
-- The type of signatures, which defines a first-order language,
-- possibly with extra modalities, and with room for defining your
-- own preferred variable type.
@[derive inhabited]
structure signature : Type (u+1) :=
    (functional_symbol : Type u := pempty)
    (relational_symbol : Type u := pempty)
    (modality : Type u := pempty)
    (vars : Type u := ulift ℕ) 
    (dec_vars : decidable_eq vars . apply_instance)
    (arity : functional_symbol → ℕ := λ_, 0)
    (rarity : relational_symbol → ℕ := λ_, 0)
    (marity : modality → ℕ := λ_, 0)
```


???

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of our implementation is the usage
of dependent types to define a signature abstraction which can be used polymorphically
to define multiple formal languages.

As can be seen, the signature contains a type of functional symbols, a type of relational symbols,
a type of modal operator symbols, a type of variables, a decision procedure for equality between variables,
and 3 maps which associate arities to each different kind of symbol.

We can see here that all of the fields are optional and come with sensible defaults.
Variables are by the default natural numbers, but any type can be chosen provided
that equality between instances of that type is decidable,
as this is required in many proofs.

[small pause]

Ok, so then the type of first-order formulas will be defined in terms an instance of this type, as a dependent type.
It will be depending on an instance of this type for its definition.

Depending on which signature we use,
a different calculus would end up being defined
; this allows us to keep all the information required to define
the most usual kinds of logical languages packed into the same type.

And since our soundness proof is agnostic about the signature we are using,
it amounts to a proof of the soundness of many different logics.

Modalities were added there to foreshadow a future development direction I have in mind, but they were ignored
in the rest of our implementations.

# Terms

```haskell
variable {σ : signature}
-- arity types

-- the type of functional symbols of arity n
def signature.nary (σ : signature) (n : ℕ) := subtype {f : σ.functional_symbol | σ.arity f = n}

-- the type of relational symbols of arity n
def signature.nrary (σ : signature) (n : ℕ) := subtype {r : σ.relational_symbol | σ.rarity r = n}

-- the predicate defining, and the type of, constants
def is_constant (f : σ.functional_symbol) := σ.arity f = 0
def signature.const (σ : signature) := σ.nary 0

-- terms in the language
inductive signature.term (σ : signature)
| var : σ.vars → signature.term
| app  {n : ℕ} (f : σ.nary n) (v : fin n → signature.term) :  signature.term

```

**Lean has poor support for nested inductive types.** 

???

TODO

Lean has poor support for what are called "nested inductive types",
which for me meant spending a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to define terms.
The definition we settled on uses the `fin n` type which is the type of natural numbers lesser than n.
The most obvious and convenient choice would be to use the dependent type of vectors, which are 
fixed dimension lists of a given type. However lean does not allow us to use 
parametric types which depend on the type being defined, 
which means we were forced to rely on the type.

# Constant Terms and Formulas

```haskell
-- constant terms. A function that lifts a constant to a term.
def signature.cterm (σ : signature) : σ.const → σ.term
| c := term.app c fin_zero_elim

--  the type of formulas in the language
inductive  signature.formula (σ : signature)
| relational {n : ℕ} (r : σ.nrary n) (v : fin n → σ.term) :  signature.formula
| for_all :  σ.vars →  signature.formula →  signature.formula
| if_then :  signature.formula →  signature.formula →  signature.formula
| equation (t₁ t₂ : σ.term) :  signature.formula
| false :  signature.formula
```

???

[short pause]

We created a simple utility to lift constant symbols to terms.
Formulas are defined inductively in the usual way from the terms.

# Proof system

This is a very long definition of the deductive system of first order logic.
